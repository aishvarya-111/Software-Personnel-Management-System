# Software-Personnel-Management-System

The primary administrative tasks of a business are handled by the Software personnel management system (SPMS). 
This makes it easier for businesses to maintain track of all their employees' information. This system gathers information on the employee, including name, ID, date of birth, salary, prior experience, etc. 
Using this system, employee information may be updated, removed, and displayed as necessary. 
The code is written in C programming, and distinct functions are constructed for each operation, such as add, update, delete, and display. 
All the functions will be provided under switch cases. 
The objective is to write data to a text file and read that data back using file handling methods. 
This system is password protected and admin can login only if he/she knows the password.
