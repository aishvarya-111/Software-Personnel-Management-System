# Software-Personnel-Management-System

The primary administrative tasks of a business are handled by the Software personnel management system (SPMS). 
This makes it easier for businesses to maintain track of all their employees' information.
Using this system, employee information may be updated, removed, and displayed as necessary. 
The code is written in C programming, and distinct functions are constructed for each operation, such as add, update, delete, and display. 
All the functions will be provided under switch cases.
